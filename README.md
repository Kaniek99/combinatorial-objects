# Combinatorial Objects

This application is part of my bachelor's thesis *Generating Combinatorial Objects* in which I present algorithms for generating permutations and combinations of any set. To generate all permutations of set, this app uses the algorithm created by Selmer Johnson and Hale Trotter.

By using the application we can generate all permutations (or combinations) of numerical set. In addition, we can generate a permutation by specifying its inversion sequence.

To run this app you need to clone this repository and run comand `go run .` inside the directory `combinatorialObjects`.

# Planned features

- generating all k-subsets

#  Limitations

Please note that it takes more time to print all permutations of an 8 element set (40320 sequences) than to just generate them.
