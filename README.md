# Combinatorial Objects

This application is part of my bachelor's thesis *Generating Combinatorial Objects* in which I present algorithms for generating permutations and combinations of any set. To generate all permutations of the set, I use the algorithm created by Selmer Johnson and Hale Trotter. I use widely common algorithm based on binary strings to generate all combinations of the set.

By using the application we can generate all permutations (or combinations) of numerical set. In addition, we can generate a permutation by specifying its inversion sequence.

To run this app you need to clone this repository and run comand `go run .` inside the directory `combinatorialObjects`.
